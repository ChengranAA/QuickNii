// BrainVoyager file formart according to the documentation https://support.brainvoyager.com/brainvoyager/automation-development/84-file-formats

// VMR structure
    // Specifications: 
    //VMR Pre-Data Header
    //BYTES	DATA TYPE	DEFAULT	DESCRIPTION
    //2	unsigned short	4	File version
    //2	unsigned short	256	DimX, dimension of X axis
    //2	unsigned short	256	DimY, dimension of Y axis
    //2	unsigned short	256	DimZ, dimension of Z axis

    //VMR Data
    //Each data element (intensity value) is represented in 1 byte. The data is organized in three loops:
    //DimZ
    //DimY
    //DimX
    //Note that the axes terminology follows the internal BrainVoyager (BV) format. The mapping to Talairach axes is as follows:
    //BV X front -> back = Y in Tal space
    //BV Y top -> bottom = Z in Tal space
    //BV Z left -> right = X in Tal space

    // This file format will not included the post header which is not necessary for the purpose of this project
